                                                <p>Investment in inventory should neither be excessive nor inadequate. It should just be optimum. Maintaining optimum level of inventory is the main aim of inventory management. Excessive investment in inventory results into more cost of fund being tied up so that it reduces the profitability, inventories may be misused, lost, damaged and hold costs in terms of large space and others. At the same time, insufficient investment in inventory creates stock-out problems, interruption in production and selling operation. Therefore, the firm may loose the customers as they shift to the competitors. Financial manager, as he involves in inventory management, should always try to put neither excessive nor inadequate investment in inventory. The importance or significance of inventory management could be specified as below:

* Inventory management helps in maintaining a trade off between carrying costs and ordering costs which results into minimizing the total cost of inventory.

* Inventory management facilitates maintaining adequate inventory for smooth production and sales operations.

* Inventory management avoids the stock-out problem that a firm otherwise would face in the lack of proper inventory management.

* Inventory management suggests the proper inventory control system to be applied by a firm to avoid losses, damages and misuses.</p>
